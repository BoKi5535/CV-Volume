Info:

This is a volume control center, which you can use to niecely listen to music. Especially when listening to old music there are big volume differences between them, which is why it's nice to change it manually at every song. But instead of clicking the buttons, why not change the volume with your hands?
Not only that, but you can also see the history of your volume, aswell as how long you have been listerning to music! Not to mention the super helpful tips below! ðŸ˜‚

How to use it:

The distance between your index and thumb decides how loud the volume is, and when you make a peace sign it mutes/unmutes! After deciding your volume with your fingers, just move your hand to the right out of your cameras vision, and continue your work!

Enjoy! (I want to continue working on this, so stay tuned for newer versions! Possibly even an app!)
